Shh!\nDon't tell anyone!\", Streeteasy.\n\"NYC's most in-demand harder-to-land secret street is uptown\", The Post.\n\"One of the most memorable aspects of Sylvan T. isn't just how perfect and uniform each house is, it's how this 19th-century time capsule is casually wedged between a laundromat and a supermarket... A set of steps with beautifully manicured hedges seems to materialize out of nowhere to lead you into a totally different time and place.\nAnd to add to the movie-set-like quality, the little street ends at the Morris-Jumel mansion, a grand Federal house that looks more like the Hudson Valley than Manhattan.\" Robert Khederian, Compass, Instagram.\n18 Sylvan Terrace, historic landmark building, sits across the Morris Jumel Mansion Museum & Park, where President Washington resided in 1776.\nWalk across with your favorite book to your stone bench in the Sunken Garden, and enjoy the central fountain and refined landscaping. Peace & safety are a staple of these blocks, right off bustling Amsterdam which abounds in services and restaurants, cafes, groceries, laundromat, Columbia Medical facilities, and all forms of transportation. \nAn assured love at first sight awaits. \n\nLAYOUT & FEATURES:\nThis spacious & charming 20 ft wide one-bedrom home presents oozing charactter; right off the unique cobblestone st., enjoy your independent access to an intimate vestibule w/ 2 closets, leading to an open Living-Dining space ornate w/ an original brick fireplace & equipped w/ remarkable storage, a convivial open kitchen, beamed BR w/ ensuite bath & bountiful storage space throughout.\nRecently meticulously restored, it maintains its Victorian pedigree while gleaming w/ the most contemporary finishes and the edge of modern improvements: double-pane insulated windows; discreet recessed lighting throughout; skim-coated plastering throughout; restored terracotta flooring; the extra-large Kitchen features abundant cabinetry, fun cubbyholes & brand new equipment: DW, MW, oversized refrigerator, easy care quartzite countertop & backsplash.\nC-Town Fresh grocery store half a block away., and C line subway right below the Mews,\n\nCOMMUNITY ACTIVITIES, UNIQUE SERVICES AND SECURITY:\nUpon lease signing, this community of 20 neighbors will invite you to enter the Sylvan Terrace association chat, and will keep you informed of the next Birthday or Crepe Party. The street video security alarm links the block to the closest precinct and gives access to all video recordings.\nA state of the art, yet redundant, security system was installed within your home, should you feel attracted to its remove control capability.\nThe tenant's association might as well calls itself Consierge: It assists in deliveries, allows temporary parking on this cobblestone pedestrian mews, insures the maintenance of a common garden strip and assists in any referrals. It is like earning the friendship of 19 families!\n\nHISTORY:\nThe splendid Jumel Terrace Historic District, centered on Sylvan Terrace, is one of the most remarkable legacies of American history & architecture. Sylvan derived from Latin \"silva\", forest; it was the wooded alley leading to the mansion. The original cobblestones & lanterns still resonate with echoes of grandeur & carriages.\n\nTRANSPORTATION:\n18 Sylvan off 160 & Amsterdam, 1 ave from\nSubway line A, B, C, D, 1,\nBus stops around the corner on St Nicholas & Amsterdam: M5, M100, M101, M102, M103, and M104.",
